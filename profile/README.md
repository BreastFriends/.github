# AI4Health.Cro 2025 – Breast Lesion Classification on Mammographic Images

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for our solution to the AI4Health innovation competition solution.

## About the Project

This project was developed as part of the [AI4Health.Cro Innovation Competition 2025](https://ai4healthcro.eu/?ht_kb=join-ai4health-cro-2025-innovation-competition). The goal was to:
- develop AI models that would assist radiologists in BIRADS score assesment and breast lesion detection from mammography images,
- create a prototype of the app for radiologists and
- develop a business strategy.

Our solution won 2nd place!

## Demo application

Check out the demo at https://breastfriends.github.io/ui.

## TODO

We will open-source the code after we finish up some details. After all, we have more ideas to test out even though the competition is over :)
